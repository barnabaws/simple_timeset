# simple_timeset
One line command to set correct time, useful in systems without RTC hardware such as Raspberry PI. It does not provide such precision as NTP, but, it should be good enough for majority of applications. There is actually no special requirements regarding system (only curl package) and network (only HTTPS query required).
